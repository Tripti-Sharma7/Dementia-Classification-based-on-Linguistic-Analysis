# Dementia-Classification-based-on-Linguistic-Analysis
Our goal is to classify if a patient has dementia /Alzheimers based on linguistic data from the DementiaBank dataset. The label is a binary value indicating if the patient has dementia (1) or not (0). The predictor is the transcripts with audio data containing sentences from patients with or without dementia.
